# Download Organizer
Basically I tried to find a download organizer that supported the following:
 - CLI Mode
 - Standalone (don't need to install some large media platform just to use it)
 - Easily configurable
 
Gave up and decided to write my own very simple solution.

## Run 
```
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python dlo.py
```
